# MetaMask Snap for Confidential ERC-20 Token Support
> Project built under a grant from Fhenix

## Project

This project aims to develop a MetaMask snap that enables the support for Fhenix’s confidential ERC-20 tokens. The snap should ensure that these tokens are visible in the MetaMask wallet UI, including accurate balance display and detailed transaction history.

## Technical Requirements

- Compatibility: Ensure the snap works seamlessly with the Fhenix network (EVM-compatible).
- Token Visibility: Display confidential ERC-20 tokens in the MetaMask UI.
- Balance Display: Accurately show token balances in the MetaMask wallet.
- Transaction History: Provide a clear and detailed history of transactions involving confidential ERC-20 tokens.
- Security: Maintain the confidentiality and integrity of transactions and balances.
- User Experience: Ensure the snap is user-friendly and doesn’t require complex configurations.


## Development Considerations:

- Integration with MetaMask’s existing API and Ethereum Provider API.
- Handling of confidential transaction data and privacy preservation.
- Testing and debugging on the Fhenix testnet.
